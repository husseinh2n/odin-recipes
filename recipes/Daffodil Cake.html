    <h3> This is a great spring angel food-type of cake made with two flavors of batter alternated in a tube pan.</h3>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li>10 egg whites</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>6 egg yolks</li>
     </ul>
     <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Wash the tube pan in hot soapy water to ensure it is totally grease-free.</li>
        <li>In a large dry glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites until frothy. 
            Add cream of tartar and salt, and continue to whip. When the whites can form soft peaks, gradually sprinkle in 1 cup sugar, 
            while continuing to beat until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. 
            Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and continue baking for another 20 minutes, or until the top of the cake springs back when pressed.</li>
     </ol>
